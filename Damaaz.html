        <h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>

        <p>
            The product is a game called “Damaaz – The Barbarian Warlock” which is a single player fast-paced action game with unique, comic style line art sprites and animations. Its genre is a Beat ‘em Up and the structure follows many of the genre’s aspects. It will have engaging boss fights with satisfying gameplay. The story of the game is told with static comic book panels, that appear on the screen. The level design consists of segments and these segments are called Encounters. An Encounter is a small quest within a level, which you must complete before you can venture forth. Encounters can be gauntlets where you must kill all the enemies, puzzles, mini-bosses, final bosses, or something similar. Sometimes the camera moves freely within an encounter (you can backtrack within limits) and sometimes it can be locked into place (an arena encounter), or it moves on tracks (escaping a rolling stone Indiana Jones –style).

        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Goal Oriented Action Planning architecture</h3>
        <p>It is clear from this tough industry that if any new game wants to attract players and set itself out from other games, it must showcase almost every its highlight features and then wish the user to engage in these deliveries within the first 2 minutes  (IQ, 2017). This conclusion comes from the consumption behaviors of people which set the demand to do more things that make them happy as the top priority when making a buying decision (Stankovic , 2021). The challenge becomes far more difficult when players first time hit the gameplay and have no idea how to get immersive with the game. As a result, a game with a good design tutorial system that rapidly rides play-ers to its most precious values might earn the highest proportion to be a winner in the game industry (Whiittee, 2014).
            Tutorials, the very first touch point between the game and gamers, along with enemy spawners contribute crucial materials to keep the game balance and ignite gamer’s curiosity reminding them to return to the game and explore its contents more. The game’s tutorial system uses sensors and a GOAP system to analyze situations at the time before deciding which tutorial will be used to help players who get stuck in a certain challenge for too long.

        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Work in a Scrum team</h3>
        <p>
            We are a multidisciplinary team including six people who invest their time in different game development skills. We have some conventions and rules before starting the project that allow team members to focus on their tasks while still guaranteeing the information is updated frequently and the obstacle is notified by other cohorts.
            As for the meetings, the project management was handled by a Scrum master following the Scrum method with daily warm-up and sprint meetings.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Crisis management</h3>
        <p>
            All team members agree on some communication principles that help us efficiently connect and make appropriate decisions in cases that might lead to considerable controversies among those in the team. Although some small arguments are unavoidable, compromising some general communication rules keeps the project going smoothly and saves us plenty of time to follow the tight schedule punctually.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Pitching</h3>
        <p>
            While the main mission of the game is to convince gamers that this is an appealing product and is good enough for them to spend their money on, the first customer we must sell out is investors who will be on our side and push the game end up in high quality if we success the pitching. We understand that game players and venture investors have separate demands and expectations which require our presentation of different designs that satisfy the question about the profitability of the project rather than solely how fun the game is.
