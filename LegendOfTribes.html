                Enter the enchanting realm of 'Legend of Tribe,' where I, a seasoned game programmer, designer, and
                storyteller, have left my mark. My primary goal has always been to create an immersive player
                experience. To achieve this, I've carefully designed the gameplay and AI system, utilizing advanced
                Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) techniques. As the driving force behind the game's development,
                I've painstakingly crafted a seamless balance between gameplay, the tutorial system, and the reward
                structure, ensuring they all work in perfect harmony.

        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Coding</h3>
        <div class="definition"><p>
            <p>I'm following a dedicated learning journey to develop my IT skills.
                It all starts with building a strong foundation by mastering essential programming concepts like
                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), design patterns, unit testing, and refactoring.
                Once I've solidified these skills, I'll move on to more advanced topics, including diving deeper into
                Data Structures and Algorithms.
                Looking ahead, my learning path includes exploring concepts such as Entity-Component-System (ECS) and
                delving into the world of databases.
                This is how I'm shaping my journey to become a proficient programmer.
            </p></div>
        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)</h3>
        <h4>What I need to do better</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Performance</h4>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Minimize the number of world state variables. Most of the boolean states must folder into one
                        enumeration</p></div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Keep plan length short: Move logic out of the planner into other systems; the planner does not
                        need to do everything; Let other specialized systems take some of the burden  Turn from
                        low-level design to high-level design</p></div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Upgrade to Dynamic system</h4>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Enable Goal to mark a child Action as completed before the child Action completes on its own 
                        The RangedAttack Action might require that the client must be within 5m of a tar-get, and then
                        monitor the status of the target to force GoTo Action to terminate early.</p></div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Enable Goal to dynamically change the requirements while child Action is still in progress  When
                        the target moves, it can change the requirement end position for child Action, or tell it to
                        move to a new destination that just became available or viable. This often force Actions to
                        monitor their requirements dynamically to make sure they are still achievable.</p></div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Evaluating and communicating the Plan’s state</h4>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Goal or Action can monitor the status of the Plan while child Actions are still running and cause
                        it to abort  A parent Action or Goal could determine the target is no longer valid (Agent are
                        dead or its intended target is no longer available) or it is no longer the best target.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>The Goal can also use its awareness of the current state of the Plan to communicate with other
                        NPCs  Notify other NPCs when GoTo Action is running.</p></div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Actions do not necessarily need to be completed as soon as they have completed one iter-ation of
                        the required Action  The RangedAttack Action can turn into allowed to take sev-eral shots while
                        it is still in available range.</p></div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Evaluating and communicating the Plan’s state</h4>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Goal or Action can monitor the status of the Plan while child Actions are still running and cause
                        it to abort  A parent Action or Goal could determine the target is no longer valid (Agent are

                </div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>The Goal can also use its awareness of the current state of the Plan to communicate with other
                        NPCs  Notify other NPCs when GoTo Action is running.</p></div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Actions do not necessarily need to be completed as soon as they have completed one iter-ation of
                        the required Action  The RangedAttack Action can turn into allowed to take sev-eral shots while
                        it is still in available range.</p></div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>--> I just replan for each shot but do not reuse the state that is still available when the Agent
                        stands right at the place to conduct RangedAttack multiple times.</p></div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>The GOAP system can keep track of success rates for Goals and Actions and can turn to use that to
                        influence planning  Require different GOAP settings for different NPC types. For example, a
                        melee NPC increases its success rate of Melee Attack and turns to allow its Me-lee Attack Action
                        lowering the cost from each success slash it conducted.</p></div>
                <div class="definition"><p>
                    <p>Use a Behaviour Graph to drive Goal selection, rather than prioritize a list of Goals. This
                        en-ables the designer to create tree- or DAG-like logic for Goal selection depending on the
                        current status of NPCs. For example, an NPC in a pre-combat state might have only one Goal to
                        consider (with a logic to cause certain Goals to be evaluated only in certain situations), and
                        another set of Goals for higher alert levels, including higher-customized logic for Goal
                        evaluations in combat situations.</p></div>

        <p>My journey in mastering the art of creating visual effects for Unity games begins with a comprehensive study
            of VFX design, starting from the very basics and progressing towards a polished end product. The next
            crucial step is the development of a particle system, which is the key to translating my design ideas into
            captivating visual experiences. To achieve this, I recognize the importance of mastering several
            prerequisites that form the foundation of this VFX section, including Shader Graph, material design, trails,
