        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Game design procedural</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the process of learning game design, I have created several essential documents, including the Game Concept, Asset and Inventory lists, Sprint Plan, and CDC Card. 
            Initially, I had reservations about investing time in paperwork, fearing it might be a time-consuming endeavor. 
            However, as I progressed through the project and encountered setbacks due to inadequate design documents, I came to a profound realization. While having a meticulous plan from the outset doesn't guarantee a successful project, I learned that not prioritizing a well-structured plan virtually assures the onset of failure. 
            This experience has underscored the critical importance of careful planning in the game design process.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Balance between difficulty and player skill</h3>
        <p>
            Balancing in game design holds a pivotal role due to two primary reasons that drive player engagement and retention: frustration and boredom. 
            These two factors are the core sources behind why individuals cease playing a game. 
            Therefore, achieving the right balance is crucial in creating an enticing and enduring gaming experience.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">F2P & Monetization</h3>
        <p>
            In implementing the Free-to-Play (F2P) monetization model for the game, I used a combination of ads and in-app purchases. 
            However, this approach didn't perform as well as expected. 
            I learned two important lessons: first, excessive ads can frustrate players, highlighting the need for careful ad placement. 
            Second, for this game, the F2P strategy, offering most gameplay for free and charging for extended content, proved to be a more effective monetization method compared to relying solely on ads.

        <h3 class="highlight-text-yellow">Mobile game marketing</h3>
        <p>
            In the realm of mobile game marketing, I've taken the initiative to create a marketing kit from scratch, comprising a compelling trailer video and attention-grabbing ad posters to capture the essence of our game and say 'hello world.' 
            However, one of the significant hurdles I encountered was the selection of appropriate marketing channels. 
            To tackle this challenge, I ventured into a variety of advertisement tools, thoroughly exploring their respective advantages and disadvantages, with a particular focus on App Store Optimization (ASO). 
            In my perspective, the pinnacle of effective marketing remains the quality of the game itself, as it serves as the most powerful and persuasive marketing tool.
